# Windsurf Rules Directory

This directory contains rule sets for Windsurf AI to follow when assisting with different types of tasks. Each `.rules` file defines a specific behavior profile that can be activated when working on particular projects or tasks.

## Available Rule Sets

- **data_science.rules**: Configuration for data science and machine learning tasks using Python ecosystem
- **cs_tutor.rules**: Guidelines for Windsurf to act as a computer science tutor
- **problem_solving.rules**: Rules for guiding problem-solving rather than providing direct solutions
- **code_structure.rules**: Project structure conventions and file organization patterns

## How to Use

1. Reference these rule sets in your Windsurf prompts to activate specific behavior profiles
2. Combine multiple rule sets for complex tasks
3. Customize existing rule sets or create new ones for your specific needs

## Benefits

- Consistent AI behavior across similar tasks
- More targeted and helpful responses
- Better alignment with your development workflow
- Improved learning and problem-solving experiences

## Example Usage
